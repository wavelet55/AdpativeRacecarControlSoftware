Found an issue with NetMQ version 4.0.0.1 which also shows up in version 3.3.3.4.
NetMQ crashes when making a socket connection... ref.  

	_cmdResponseSocket = new RequestSocket();

	if (_cmdResponseSocket != null)
	{
		_cmdResponseSocket.Connect(connStr);  //**** Crash Here  *****
		_cmdResponseSocket.ReceiveReady += new EventHandler<NetMQSocketEventArgs>(EventClientReceiveMsg);
	} 
 
The crash only occurs on the Nvidia TX1 and TX2 machines.  

I downloaded the NetMQ Source code from GitHub:  https://github.com/zeromq/netmq
The issue was found in the NetMQ/src/NetMQ/Core/Utils/Clock.cs object.   The constructor
opens:  s_rdtscSupported = Opcode.Open();  and returns true ok.
In the         
	/// <summary>
        /// Return the CPU's timestamp counter, or 0 if it's not available.
        /// </summary>
        public static long Rdtsc()
        
routine, the call to:  Opcode.Rdtsc() 
	return s_rdtscSupported ? (long)Opcode.Rdtsc() : 0;

Causes the crash.  To fix the issue I change the routine to:

	public static long Rdtsc()
	{
	    return NowUs();   //a method in Clock which returns a timestamp in microseconds.
	}

This fixed the issue.

Use the repaired dll:   NetMQ_V4.0.0.1_NVidiaTXnFix.dll.

I submitted a bug with my fix to the NetMQ team via GitHub.
